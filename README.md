### Is this an official GA4GH style guide I have to follow?

This style guide has not gone through any formal approval process and is not mandatory in any way. Having said that, this style guide reflects what we consider good development practices, which have been validated over the years in the context of several GA4GH products. Consistency and interoperability are important - developers often work on several specifications across a range of workstreams, and GA4GH products live in the same ecosystem, where they need to interoperate. If you're looking to implement your standard in a consistent and interoperable way, please consider this document. For ease of use, we recommend linking to [this README.md](README.md) from the README.md in the repository of your specification.
